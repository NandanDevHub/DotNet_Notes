# .Net Core Platform

## Components in .NET Core Architecture

There are the <mark style="color:purple;">four</mark> components that are consistent into the.NET Core architecture.

* CLI tools
* Roslyn - is our language compiler for C sharp and basic.
* CoreFX -  is providing a set of frameworks, libraries which are common to all the supported programming languages.
* Core CLR-  which is a JIT Just in time based CLR that provides a memory management and understanding the managed and unmanaged code along with the security and authentication aspects.

## .NET Core Language Compiliers

* The.NET Core language compilers include.NET Core programming aspects which are supported by our <mark style="color:red;">Roslyn</mark><mark style="color:orange;">,</mark> which is a C sharp, F sharp and Visual Basic.&#x20;
* First of all, when you write any C sharp program or a.NET Core application, <mark style="background-color:purple;">t</mark><mark style="background-color:purple;">**hey are compiled into the intermediate language, which is then IL code**</mark> **as well,** which is a low language code that will be converted and executed by the.NET run time environment provided by the Core CLR.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:red;">Roslyn</mark> is the compiler used for C sharp and basic, a Visual Basic, which is a common language compiler word for the supported programming languages.
* F sharp compilers use to compile the F sharp code, which is known as FSC.&#x20;
* C sharp compiler has CSC and all.

## .NET Core CLR

* Core CLR is the.NET Run time CLR used in.NET Core application, whether it is a console application or Windows application.&#x20;
* It is responsible for compiling and executing the.NET Core applications.
* <mark style="background-color:purple;">First of all, your code gets converted into the low level programming language or an intermediate language, and then gets compiled into the associated programming aspects.</mark>&#x20;
* Providing features like garbage collections, just in time compilation, memory management, exception handling, authentication and authorization.
* It provides a high level flexible implementation that makes my application robust, scalable and fast.&#x20;
* It is optimized for modern hardware being used in today's hydration in the latest execution environments where the application gets developed and deployed.
* &#x20;It is lightweight and modular as compared to the.NET framework. It is an improvised version of.NET Core CLR. It uses the less resources than the full.NET framework

## .NET CoreFX

* As.NET is a multilingual framework or providing the support to the multiple programming languages.&#x20;
* There are some common set of libraries that provided functionality to the.NET Core application, whether you're using Visual Basic or C Sharp.&#x20;
* It provides a wide range of libraries for developing different applications, providing the file input, output, networking, and collections, generics and other more iterations,&#x20;
* It is modular so that the developers can choose the libraries that are needed for the applications as well.

## Summery .NET Core Architecture

**Introduction to .NET CLI**

* The .NET command-line interface (CLI) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications.
* The .NET Core CLI is installed with .NET Core SDK



**.NET CLI Commands & Platform**

The following is a command structure.

_`dotnet <command> <argument> <option>`_

* All the commands start with driver named dotnet. The driver starts the execution of the specified command. After dotnet, we can supply command (also known as verb) to perform a specific action. Each command can be followed by arguments and options
* .NET Framework includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It serves as the execution engine of .NET Framework and offers many services such as memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management. All programs written for .NET Framework are executed by the CLR.
* Programs written for .NET Framework are compiled into Common Intermediate Language code (CIL), as opposed to being directly compiled into machine code. During execution, an architecture-specific just-in-time compiler (JIT) turns the CIL code into machine code

### Q\&A

* NET CLI is a command-line interface used for developing, building, and managing .NET projects and applications.
* The .NET Core platform is used for developing and running applications on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Roslyn is a language compiler used in .NET development.
* The "`dotnet restore"` command is used to restore dependencies for a .NET Core project.
* The .NET Core platform includes the language compilers, the Core CLR (Common Language Runtime), and coreFx (Framework Libraries).
* The Core CLR and coreFx are both components of the .NET Core platform that work together to provide a runtime environment and a set of APIs for building applications.
