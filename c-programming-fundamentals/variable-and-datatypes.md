# Variable and DataTypes

## Variables

* Basically, a variable is a symbolic name given to a memory location or you can say a named storage location in computer memory that holds a value.&#x20;
* Variables are used to store the value which can be manipulated, assigned or reassigned at any stage of the program.&#x20;
* In C sharp all the variables must be declared before they can be used. This means the name and type of variable must be known before they can be assigned a value. That is why C Sharp is called a statically typed language.&#x20;
* Variable is basically a basic unit of storage in a program which holds a value and that value can be used throughout the program execution.&#x20;

* This is the basic syntax of declaring a variable. First we need to define the data type of the variable and then name of the variable, then whatever value you would like to assign into it.

## Types of Variables

We have different types of variable that we can use in programming.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">Local variable -</mark> To be declared within a block
* <mark style="color:purple;">Instance or nonstatic variables -</mark> Which will be declared at the class level&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Static or class variable -</mark> Which will be common across all the objects.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Constant variable  -</mark> Which cannot be changed throughout the program execution
* <mark style="color:purple;">Read only variables.</mark>

## Datatypes

* Data type plays an important role while declaring the variables which defines the type of data and <mark style="color:yellow;">according to that the memory gets allocated to the variable.</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:orange;">C Sharp is a strongly and statically typed language so defining the data type means defining how much memory a variable needs and what kind of data we can store into a particular variable.</mark>&#x20;
* It means we must declare the type of a variable that indicates the kind of value it is going to store such as integer, float, decimal, text, string, date and so on.&#x20;

* Above shown is a way to declare the variable and define the type. Here we have string where that is a string type of variable that stores the group of characters. 100 is a numeric value that will be stored into the int type and so on.

## Types of Datatypes

Data types are categorized into three broader categories <mark style="color:purple;">value data type</mark>, <mark style="color:purple;">pointer data type</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">reference data type</mark>.&#x20;

* Value data type directly stores the value
* Reference data type stores the reference of the other object, types string types classes which is a collection of data members and member functions.And the interfaces and&#x20;
* Pointer holds the reference of the other variables as well.

* <mark style="color:yellow;">`string name = "Nandan"; -`</mark> Although string is a reference type but their syntax comes into the primitive and value type declaration that store a group of characters.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">float discount = 1000.50F;</mark>  <mark style="color:green;">-</mark> It's a float value that needs to be declared with the float data type and assign with F
