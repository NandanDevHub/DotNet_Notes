# Advanced Concepts in C# - I

We will understand the&#x20;

* Difference between abstract classes and interfaces and when to use them.&#x20;
* Static classes and extension methods which are commonly used in C sharp programming.&#x20;
* Partial Classes & Partial Methods

### Abstract Class

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instant created, and it can have both abstract and non abstract members.&#x20;

### Interface

An interface, on the other hand, only defines the signature of methods and properties and does not contain any implementation.

Static classes and extension methods which are used to provide additional functionality to existing classes.&#x20;

Partial classes and partial methods, which allow you to split a class into multiple files and define a method in one part of the class and implement it in another part.
