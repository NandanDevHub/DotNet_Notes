# Jump Statements

Jump statements are used to transfer control from one point to another in a program. There are five keywords used for jump statements: break, continue, goto, return, and throw.

* <mark style="color:purple;">Break</mark> statement helps us to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Continue</mark> statement helps us to skip over the execution part of the loop on a certain condition.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Goto</mark> statement is used to transfer the control to the label statement in the program.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Return</mark> statement terminates the execution of the method and returns the control to the calling method,
* <mark style="color:purple;">Throw,</mark> which is used to create an object of any valid exception class with the help of new keyword manually. Basically we use throw keyword with exception handling.

Here is a summary of the key points covered:

1. Break statement: It is used to terminate a loop or statement in which it is present.
2. Continue statement: It helps to skip over the execution part of a loop on a certain condition, but the loop continues.
3. Goto statement: It transfers control to a labeled statement in the program. It is often used with switch cases or specific line numbers.
4. Return statement: It terminates the execution of a method and returns control to the calling method.
5. Throw statement: It is used to create an object of any valid exception class manually.
