# Operators and Operators Precedence

## &#x20;Operators & Operands

* <mark style="color:orange;">Operators</mark> are symbols that are used to perform operations on <mark style="color:purple;">operands</mark>.&#x20;
* They are used to define and implement calculation, comparison, and computation while writing a big programs.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">Operands</mark> maybe variables or constants depends upon the requirement.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:orange;">Operators</mark> are used to manipulate variables and values stored into those variables.&#x20;

C-Sharp supports a number of <mark style="color:orange;">operators</mark> that are classified based on the type of operations they perform. For example -&#x20;

* Arithmetic operators to do the calculations
* Relational operators to do the comparisons

## Types of Operators

They are broadly categorized in three types.&#x20;

Unary operators, binary operators, and ternary operators.&#x20;

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">Unary operators</mark> are the operators in which we need only one operand and one operator.&#x20;
2. <mark style="color:orange;">Binary operator</mark> In this we need at least two operands and one operator.&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:green;">Ternary operator</mark> is a conditional operator that is a short form or short extension of conditional statements, that is, if and else statement

Here in above image we can see that the <mark style="color:orange;">binary operator</mark> is further categorized into other types like&#x20;

1. <mark style="color:purple;">Arithmetic operator</mark> to do the calculation
2. <mark style="color:purple;">Relational operator</mark> to do the comparisons
3. <mark style="color:purple;">Logical operator</mark> to check their logic building AND, OR, and NOT.&#x20;
4. <mark style="color:purple;">Bitwise operators</mark> to shift the values&#x20;
5. <mark style="color:purple;">Assignment operator</mark> to assign the value and do the arithmetic operators along with that.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Ternary operator,</mark> also known as a conditional operator, <mark style="color:green;">as a shorthand of condition that we use with the help of if and else statement.</mark>
