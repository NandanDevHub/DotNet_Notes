# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## What is OOPS?

Basically, <mark style="color:purple;">Object-oriented programming i</mark>s a way of developing software applications <mark style="color:yellow;">using real world terminologies</mark> to create entities that interact with one another using objects.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">C Sharp is an object-oriented programming language</mark> that supports the OOPs paradigm.&#x20;
* As object-oriented programming makes the application flexible, easy to manage, or helps in adding new features, reusable, well-structured, and easy to debug and test.&#x20;
* Codes can be reused without any redundancy.
* The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and their functions that operate on them, so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.&#x20;
* Because the <mark style="background-color:purple;">key feature of object-oriented programming is data hiding.</mark>

## Components of OOPS

There are six components that needs to be discussed in object-oriented programming.

That is classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Classes & Objects

A <mark style="color:red;">class</mark> define the structure using <mark style="color:purple;">method</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">properties</mark> that resemble the real world entity.&#x20;

For example, <mark style="color:red;">employee</mark> is in <mark style="color:red;">class</mark>. The <mark style="color:orange;">name, salary, designation</mark> are the <mark style="color:orange;">properties</mark>. <mark style="color:purple;">Calculate salary, paying for the extra</mark>, these are the <mark style="color:purple;">methods</mark> which define the behaviors.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Object</mark> is the main important component that helps in accessing the members of the <mark style="color:red;">class</mark>, whether it's inside the class or outside the class.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">Objects</mark> are instances of the class <mark style="color:green;">that holds different data in property fields</mark> and can interact with other objects too.&#x20;

## Encapsulation & Abstraction

<mark style="background-color:purple;">Encapsulation means hiding of data.</mark>&#x20;

Whatever data members we declare inside the <mark style="background-color:red;">class</mark> are by default <mark style="color:purple;">encapsulated</mark>.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">If you would like to access from outside the class definition, you need to abstract them with the help of access modifiers, that is public, private, protected, and internal.</mark>&#x20;

## Inheritance & Polymorphosim

<mark style="color:purple;">Inheritance plays an vital role in programming because it helps in reusability of the data</mark> and also reduces time and efforts of a programmer.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">Polymorphism means one interface, multiple functions, where the one operation is to be done in different entities so that we can define a contract and that contract to be followed in all the classes.</mark>

&#x20;For all the entities, the property would remain same, the method would remain same, but their functionality would be different. That is called we can override the behaviors.
