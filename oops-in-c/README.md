The <mark style="color:purple;">Four pillars of OOP</mark> -  <mark style="background-color:orange;">Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism</mark>.&#x20;

Fundamental building blocks of C-Sharp program - Classes and Objects, \
\
Access modifiers which allow you to control the level of access to classes, methods, and their members have in your code.&#x20;

Constructors which are special methods that are called when an object is created, and how it can be used to initialize objects.

Inheritance - To create derive classes that inherit properties and methods from base classes, and how to override and hide methods in derive classes.&#x20;

Methods, structures.
